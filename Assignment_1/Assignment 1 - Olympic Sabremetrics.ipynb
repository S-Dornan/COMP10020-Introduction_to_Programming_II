    "In this lab you will be tasked with exercising your key Python programming skills. The **120 Years of Olympic History** dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) contains details of evry olympic appearance (Summer & Winter) from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. We will use a reduced version of this dataset containing details of games since 1960. The following code block reads data from a data file (*'athlete_events_since_1960.csv'*) and stores  this in a list of dictionary objects, each of which contains the details of a athlete appearance. The details stored about each athlete appearanace are stored in a dictionary object with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ID**: A unique numeric ID for each athlete (an athlete appearing at multiple games will always use the same ID)\n",
    "* **Name**:\tThe name of the athlete\n",
    "* **Sex**: The sex of the athlete (in olympic games only female (F) and male (M) are recorded\n",
    "* **Age**: The age of the athlete at the time of the appearance\n",
    "* **Height**: The athlete's height (cm) at the time of the competition\n",
    "* **Weight**: The athlete's weight (kg) at the time of the competition\n",
    "* **Team**: The team the athlete was representing (this is usually a country but in some events at earlier olympics it can be somthing else, for example the boat that an athlete was part of the cre for). \n",
    "* **NOC**: The National Olympic Committee 3-letter code\tof the country the athlete was competing for\n",
    "* **Games**: The games the appearance took place in\n",
    "* **Year**: The year of the appearance\t\n",
    "* **Season**: Whether this apperance was part of *Winter* or *Summer* games\n",
    "* **City**: The city the games took place in\n",
    "* **Sport**: The sport that athlete apperaed in\t\n",
    "* **Event**: The event the athlete took part in\n",
    "* **Medal**: What medal (if any) the athlete won in this event."
